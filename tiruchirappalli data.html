<div>
    <p class="p3">Tiruchirappalli, fondly called as Trichy is one of the important districts of the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

        What is more, Trichy is reckoned as the fourth most prominent municipal corporation and the fourth most magnanimous urban agglomeration (extensive urban centre or town region consisting of the built-up surface area of a primal place) in Tamil Nadu.</p>
</div><br>
<div>
    <p class="p3">The district is looked at as an important industrial hub in the state as the presence of industries and factories like Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Golden Rock Railway Workshops, Ordnance Factory Trichy (OFT) and Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project (HAPP) plays a crucial role in the state's economic system and provides employment to thousands of people.</p>

<div>
    <h1 class="about">Trichy: <span class="span">Past and Present</span></h1>
</div><br>
<div>
    <p class="p3">Trichy is valued for its age old character as the region has been under the domination of all three major Tamil kingdoms namely Cholas, Pallavas, Pandyas and many other illustrious kingdoms which include the Carnatic state, Nayaka kingdoms, Sultans, Kingdom of Bisnagar and finally under the mighty British rule. Also, Trichy acted as a determinative topographic point during the wars between British and the French East India companies. It is significant to note that the capital city of Chola dynasty (one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the history of southern India) dated back to 300 BC was “Woraiyur or Urayur” which is a part of contemporary Trichy district.</p>
