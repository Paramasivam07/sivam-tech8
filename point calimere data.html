        <p>Tamil Nadu is a State with a rich forest density. Home to flora and fauna of varied species, these forests include a number of wildlife sanctuaries that are visited by tourists from far and wide. Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary is one such place that you cannot afford to miss on your tour to Tamil Nadu. An exceptionally beautiful strip of land, the Calimere sanctuary is thronged by various animal species that offer you a delightful visual treat. </p>

    <div class="div1">
        <p>Created in 1967, the Point Calimere Sanctuary primarily focuses on the protection and conservation of the black antelopes, an endangered and endemic species that are found in this region. Located 11 kms away from Vedaranyam, the sanctuary covers an area of 17.26 sq.kms. It’s a sandy coast covered in saline swamp and thorny scrub around the backwaters. The region also boasts of the presence of many mangroves owing to its coastal properties. Wild boar, macaque, black buck, chital etc. are some of the animals that you find commonly in Point Calimere. The sanctuary also hosts a number of bird species including stilts, plovers, turns and teals. Migratory birds like flamingos and waterfowl can also be seen in this region. </p>

        <p>Moreover, being on the coastal side, the sanctuary also offers rare glimpses of the water world. As you wait patiently, be amazed by the sightings of dancing dolphins that offer a spectacle. You could also come across the sight of turtles walking on the shore peacefully. 

            In short, this sanctuary is one that you just cannot afford to miss on your trip.</p>

    <h2 class="div2">EXPLORE</h2><br>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>Point Calimere spans 21.5 sq km and is located close to Tiruchirapalli and Thanjavur —the erstwhile capitals of the Chola Empire. The buffer area of the sanctuary is open to all who purchase a visiting ticket, but the core area of Calimere is accessible only with prior permission from the Wildlife Warden at the Forest Department office at Nagapattinam (04365-253092). Visitors must be accompanied by a guide, approved by the forest department, to visit the core area.</p>

    <div class="div1">
        <p>Near the sanctuary gate, there are grasslands with patches of thorny shrubs while the seaside of the sanctuary has golden sands and fishermen’s boats lined along the shore. This area also has a 13-metre-high, functioning lighthouse, constructed by the British in 1890, near the ruins of a Chola lighthouse. Throughout the sanctuary, watchtowers exist for birding enthusiasts. The highest point of the sanctuary has a religious shrine called Ramar Padam, or stone footprints of Rama. Devotees make a beeline for the small shrine during Ram Navami.</p>
    </div><br>
    <h2 class="div2">WILDLIFE</h2><br>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>The sanctuary is a relatively safe place for blackbuck, and chital deer, since the only predators here are jackals and free-ranging stray dogs. Also frequently seen, are wild ponies, grazing in the grassy, open areas of the sanctuary. This is thanks to the British, who attempted to breed ponies in Calimere in the early 1900s, to use as pack animals in the nearby port of Nagapattinam. The experiment did not go as planned, resulting in a population of feral ponies with tawny hides and flowing manes. Deeper in the sanctuary, the woods are home to small civets, wild boars, and monitor lizards.</p>
