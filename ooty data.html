    <h1 class="history1">Queen of Hills- Ooty</h1><br>
    <div class="div">
        <p>Udagamandalam, popularly as Ooty is among the highest hill stations in India. With an elevation of about 2,200 meters above sea level, the weather here is always pleasant. It is very common to find NO FANS here as they are not needed at all! Summer in Tamil Nadu, specially in Chennai is known to be amongst the worst in the country. In such a season, just 500 kilometers away, Ooty weather makes you want to get bundled up in a blanket! Such was the weather, when we visited Ooty in May.</p>

    <div class="div">
        <p>The most affordable way to travel to Ooty from Chennai is by TNSTC buses which can be booked online. The cost of ticket is roughly INR.400/- for each journey and the journey time is 12 hours.</p>

            We reached Ooty early in the morning. We had found this place called "TeeStay Villa" online where we had booked our accommodation for the first two days. The third day was booked at a hotel facing Ooty Lake. We highly recommend Teestay Villa for everyone who wants a peaceful time among nature.

The town has expanded well thanks to being a tourist hotspot but at the same time has lost it's essence of being a hill station unlike Kodaikanal which is still relatively unaffected by tourism. Nevertheless, the outskirts of Ooty are still the same. Trotting around here is fun.

    <div class="div">
        <p>On the first day, we went to Pykara Lake which is about 40km from the town. There are state transport buses by which you can commute to the lake.

            Pykara Lake: It's a well developed tourist spot where one can see the Pykara Lake as well as the Pykara Falls. The falls are not plunge waterfalls but the water flow rate is high and makes it a pleasant sight to watch. There is a hill next the falls where one can just lie and enjoy the scene.</p>
    </div><br>
    <div class="div">
        <p>From Pykara Falls, we proceeded to Needle Rock View Point which is about 40kms. from there. State Transport buses are available from Pykara falls to Needle Rock View points for about INR.50/- .

            Needle Rock View Point: This view point gives some stunning panoramic views of the valley surrounding it. The complete area is lush green and one can only see trees till their eyes can take them.</p>
