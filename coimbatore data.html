            An exquisite region, which always takes pride on abundant varieties of industrialization, was once ruled by the Sangam Cheras dynasty. It has now turned to be one of the most happening districts in the textiles, industrial, commercial, educational, Information technology, and healthcare sectors. Coimbatore is proudly referred as the manufacturing hub of Tamil Nadu. The Southern Manchester Kongu Nadu served as the Eastern entrance to the gap of Palakkad. The trade between Muziris and Arikamedu in South India was extended by the Roman Coimbatore. In the 10th century CE, Medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu. During the 15th century, the region came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire. To enhance the trade, Cholas constructed “Rajakesari Peruvazhi”, a highway. In the 17th century, when Vijayanagara Empire fell, Madurai Nayaks reigned the power and established the “Palayakkar system”, an independent kingdom, where Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams.
