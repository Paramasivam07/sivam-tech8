    <h2 class="mean">History of Madurai Meenakshi Temple</h2><br>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>The temple is considered to be one of the oldest and most significant temples in India, with a Madurai Meenakshi Amma Temple history that dates back more than 2500 years. According to legend, the temple was built by the Pandya king, Kulasekara Pandya, in the 6th century CE. The king was childless and prayed to Lord Shiva for a child. He was blessed with a daughter who was later named Meenakshi. She was considered to be an incarnation of the goddess Parvati, and at the age of 21, she took over the reins of the kingdom and ruled with great wisdom and justice. Meenakshi later met Lord Shiva, and they fell in love. They were married in a grand ceremony, which was attended by all the gods and goddesses. The temple was built to celebrate their marriage and to honor the goddess Meenakshi.</p>

        <p>Over the years, the temple has undergone several renovations and additions, with the most significant one being done during the reign of the Nayak dynasty in the 16th century. They added the towering gopurams (gateway towers), which are considered to be some of the finest examples of Dravidian architecture. Today, the Madurai Meenakshi Temple is a popular tourist destination and a significant pilgrimage site for Hindus. The temple complex covers an area of 15 acres and has 14 magnificent gopurams, each one adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures. Madurai Meenakshi temple architecture is a true masterpiece of art and a testament to the rich cultural heritage of India.</p>
